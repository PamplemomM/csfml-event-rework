# CSFML Event Rework

I didn‚Äôt like how CSFML handled events, so I made my own version. This repository is still in work.
It is a rework of the CSFML event library, designed to improve functionality and usability for graphical programming.

## Features

- Enhanced event handling for CSFML.
- Simplified API for ease of use.
- Improved performance and reliability.

    git clone git@github.com:PamplemomM/csfml-event-rework.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd csfml-event-rework
    ```
3. Build the project using your preferred build system.


### Testing

To test the project, follow these steps:

1. Build the project:
    ```bash
    make

3. Feel free to check how the `main_test.c` works to adapt it to your project.
